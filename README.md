<h2>Requirements</h2>


This mod list works best if installed on a SSD.

It will require 240 GB of space (the downloads can be deleted once it‚Äôs working to save space 74 GB).

You need a clean & legal copy of Fallout 4 from Steam, as well as all DLC, EXCEPT the High Resolution Texture Pack

<h2>Install Steps</h2>


<h4>Step 1 - Folder set-up (Optional Step)</h4>


_(This step is optional if you want to keep your file structure clean and don‚Äôt have your own method)_

Create a folder called ‚ÄúModding‚Äù anywhere on your SSD, away from protected folders like Program Files

In this, create a folder called ‚ÄúWasteland Genesis‚Äù

And create a folder called ‚ÄúWabbajack‚Äù

And create a folder called ‚ÄúNexus Files‚Äù.

My file structure looks like this

C:Modding

C:Modding\Nexus Files

C:Modding\Wabbajack

C:\Modding\Wasteland Genesis

<h4>Step 2 - Downloading Wasteland Genesis</h4>


From Nexus

Download Wasteland Genesis.zip

Download Bodyslide Output.zip

_(You can put these into your C:Modding\Nexus Files folder if you use the same structure as me)_

Unzip both files and save them for later

The contents of your folder should look like this


![image23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/243744e1-4756-430c-a466-2427bfa841d4)



<h4>Step 3 - Download Wabbajack</h4>


You will also need to download and install Wabbajack from here [https://www.wabbajack.org/](https://www.wabbajack.org/)

Put the Wabbajack.exe into your Wabbajack folder

_(Note: I‚Äôve already run Wabbajack.exe which is why I have the extra contents in this pic)_


![image9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be196543-8139-455e-af23-ab279d9c77b6)



<h4>Step 4 - Run Wabbajack</h4>


Open the Wabbajack file and select the Wabbajack.exe


![image28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7c4f9c4-20e0-4740-8d06-c1715635719c)



<h4>Step 5 - Using Wabbajack</h4>


Select ‚ÄòInstall from Disk‚Äô The middle option.


![image30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c16d7386-3764-4254-9b63-d45ed8ea68b8)



This will take you to the next screen where you select the file and installation locations.


![image34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac1fb41-7c0a-4fe8-b0a9-4262effd6da8)



Under Target Modlist select the file ‚ÄúWasteland Genesis.wabbajack‚Äù (not the .meta.json file) from the Nexus Folder that you created earlier.


![image32](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1e805c9-de4a-4fee-bdb3-67f588d3295f)



The other 2 fields fill themselves out, but you can change them if you want

<h4>Step 6 - Manual File Downloads</h4>


You will be prompted to manually download 2 files.

<h5>Step 6.1 - MiscHairStyle</h5>


Press the Blue download button and close any pop ups it opens.


![image17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/329669c6-a0f8-4a4d-aea8-9665eb836774)



<h5>Step 6.2 - OCBP body physics</h5>


üî¥ ***The link takes you to Lovers Lab where there are porn pictures and it is strictly NSFW.***

You will also have to sign in.

If you don‚Äôt have an account you will have to make one, but it just requires an email and password.

The OCBP download page looks like this:


![image8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef4cb383-eb18-442d-b817-c7060afd02ae)



Select the download button for OCBP_3.1.2_CBBE.zip

This download often fails, so I will tell you how to download and install manually

<h4>Step 7 - Correcting OCBP download failure</h4>


The OCBP Manual file will probably fail

You will get an error for OCBP, via a web page link


![image16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4f40ebd-6934-4212-88d1-9e3819484d3f)



This will flag an install failure on the Wabbajack UI as well.

_(Note: You may not get this error straight away, just wait for it to pop up)_


![image29](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d13caf8-4597-4a2e-96c4-951a6e12f246)



You can click the link on the web page to take you to the download page.


![image16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe0b38dd-5c4f-4f68-bf79-71ad8485d742)



WARNING:

üî¥ ***The link takes you to Lovers Lab where there are porn pictures and it is strictly NSFW.***

You will also have to sign in

If you don‚Äôt have an account you will have to make one, but it just requires an email and password

From the link, download 3.1.2_CBBE.zip (it‚Äôs the same page as before)


![image8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e8ecdf-c1e6-474a-85f7-f65da452b6da)

and drop into your Wasteland Genesis\Downloads folder

DO NOT unzip the archive file!


![image27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f3f47d-b05c-4ada-ad80-95b85243b9f0)



<h4>Step 8 - Continue with Installation</h4>


Your Wabbajack UI will look like this, so click the Main Menu button (with the left pointing arrow) in the bottom right section, that says Installation Failed and is flashing red


![image29](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ed2990a-d1a9-4d0f-8a06-200493f15edf)



Then start the install process again (as per Step 5) and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">it will carry on where it left off</span>. DO NOT select the Overwrite Installation check box or you will have to re-download everything!

All the original setting will be saved, so just press the ‚Äòplay‚Äô button


![image34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89a0bfdb-89bd-4a29-8d71-0022009ee6cf)



<h4>Step 9 - Installation Complete</h4>


When Project Genesis has completed, you should have a screen that looks like this


![image21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ddc1edb-dcbc-41f1-a052-2645784445f7)



<h4>Step 10 - Run Wasteland Genesis</h4>


Click on install folder and it will take you to the folder with all the mods, MO2 and other files needed to run this mod list


![image10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18119724-c262-448e-a001-69935ac90008)



<h4>Step 11 - Run Mod Organizer</h4>


Now select Wasteland Genesis.exe. The very last file which will open a portable version of MO2

<h4>Step 12 - Adding Bodyslide Output</h4>


Get the extracted contents of Bodyslide Output.zip that you extracted earlier.


![image12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/996e6975-d889-4b64-b81a-b6d20e4a154c)



Put the extracted file (Bodyslide Output, NOT the .zip file) straight into the left pane of MO2, under Caliente‚Äôs Beautiful Bodies Enhancer (_This can be found at the top of the Body, Skin & Hair separator_) Priority number 57.


![image6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5a53b53-697f-4f6d-b80d-09be8303d713)



Then activate the mod, by clicking the circle on the left


![image25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ff9c76f-856d-40dd-b2b7-7c5acdb2b241)



This will ensure all the clothing fits the character nicely and uses the body I use in my videos.

You may see this when dropping the file into MO2. Just click ok.


![image2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df551831-3909-4387-9924-80317caf2093)



<h5>Step 12.a - Alternative method to add Bodyslide Output</h5>


An alternative method to do this is to copy (Ctrl+C) the Bodyslide Output file (From your Nexus folder), open the 'mods' folder in your Wasteland Genesis install file 


![image39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb8e544b-51f3-4e41-bafc-1bbb9f7b47aa)



And paste the file here


![image35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77980a29-8eec-42c2-952e-72a5765fb742)



Press F5 to refresh MO2. This mod will be right at the bottom, under animations


![image3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b2a68af-e954-40fe-89f5-3457aa986c42)


Simply click and hold it, then drag it up to just under Caliente‚Äôs Beautiful Body Enhancer., as per Step 11. Make sure to activate it!

You should now be good to go.

<h4>Step 13 - Run the game!</h4>



So click Run on the F4SE Loader on the right of the screen and the game should load.


![image31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13ee377-09fa-49f8-a2f9-d327458e206e)


<h4>Step 14 - Enjoy</h4>
